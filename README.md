# Tic-Tac-Toe

I am implementing a Minimax algorithm that plays against an user (human) at tic-tac-toe. 
Right now I am trying to find bugs in the minimax / check_win function, since the computer always plays the first available move instead of the best one, and in some cases the win is not detected.
